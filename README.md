# ga-project-2 - Patrick Kittle
 React Front End Project

**Recruitment Web Site - Fairplay**
I have chosen to create a recruitment portal app for my project 2. 

*Overview*
The app will consist of 3 key areas:
- User/Job Seeker
- Recruiter/Job Poster
- Admin Page (Site owners)

*Basic Functionailty*
I will be deploying the bare bones of the site for the project submission, but I will be using this projhect moving forward for a personal business enterprise.

1. A user will be able to browse to the main page and view (public) job postings wihtout logging in
2. User will be able to signup
3. User will be able to signin
4. After signin, user can set their personal details and job skills - these will be saved to the database
5. Job Postings will be aligned with users skills to show the recomended job openings

6. A recruiter wil be able to signup
7. A recruiter will be able to signin
8. A recruiter will be able to add job posting with a job description, key skills and location information

9. An admin portal will allow for the sdite owners to administer users accounts only at MVP

The above represents an MVP for a business launch - however I do not believe I will have time to deploy all of this functionality

**Routes**
I will use 3 routes for the app:
1. Landing '/'
2. Users '/users'
3. Recruiters '/recruiters'
4. Admin '/admin'

**Technologies Used**

Requirements Met:
- Javascript
- React Framework
- Airtable via API/Fetch Syntax

*Additional Technologies Used*
Google Auth
Material UI
STRETCH: Firebase (TBC)
STRETCH: Adzuna API (to pull public job postings into the site to drive traffic)

**Important Links**
Kanban Board Link: Check as I cannot make this public without paying
Live Site Link: TBC
Wireframes Link: TBC - Again I canont make public without user signin - to check on that
